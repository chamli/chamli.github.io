My name is Mohamed CHAMLI . software engineer.

I love CTFs, I do almost every online CTF available on [ctftime.org](http://ctftime.org). My main focus is on web application security for the CTF team [DCUA](https://ctftime.org/team/762) in Online CTF.

When I'm not doing CTFs, I usually work on bug bounties programs. I also post writeups for
challenges from time to time.

Here are some bug bounty websites :
  - [Hackerone](https://hackerone.com)
  - [Bugcrowd](https://bugcrowd.com)
  - [Yogosha](https://yogosha.com)
